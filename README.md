The car itself has 5 features, it can act as a Line follower, can act as Obstacle Avoiding, also can be controlled by IR remote, and lastly Bluetooth app(which can give commands via the buttons placed while creating and also using voice commands), additionally can be controlled using IR remote and App simultaneously too.
